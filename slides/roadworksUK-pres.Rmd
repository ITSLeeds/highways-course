## Abstract

This presentation reports on the findings and outcomes of a three-month study funded by the RAC Foundation, based on data provided by Elgin, a company which hosts the website https://roadworks.org.
The main findings on the number and type of works demonstrate the diversity of reporting conventions accross the UK, highlighting the potential for harmonisation. We'll also touch on data on 'Section 58 Restrictions'; traffic disruptions (thanks to data from TomTom); and  visitors to the roadworks.org website.
The presentation will culminate in a live demo of the R package **roadworksUK**, software we wrote for the project.

This shows us 3 things about road works: ubiquity (caused by fact roads are used for lots more than transport); impact on road users; and wider impacts.

# The value of visualisation/analyisis

.pull-left[

- It's great to have data

- But it can only be used if it can be understood

- And that involves visualisation

- E.g. 1: Popensity to Cycle Tool: http://www.pct.bike/

- E.g. 2: 'geoplumber': http://www.geoplumber.com/deck

### We use roadworks to refer to all disruptions on the road network

# Live demo

## But first: what we did + what's possible

.pull-left[


- Who has heard of 'R' (before today)?

- Who understands this?:

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)
pkg = "ITSLeeds/roadworksUK"
install_github(pkg)
```

- R is a *programming language*

]

.pull-right[

- Good news: it's free

- And increasingly easy to use

- Thanks to innovations like RStudio:
