## Outline

- Stats refresher: plots and descriptive statistics
- Predictive models
- Using packages: examples with the tidyverse
- Exercises

## Data exploration vs statistics

Data analysis can be divided into two parts [:
- hypothesis generation (exploratory analysis)
- hypothesis confirmation (sometimes called confirmatory analysis)

- Exploratory analysis is sufficient to answer many questions
- Hypothesis testing is an advanced topic that should be done separate to the exploratory analysis

## Statistical rethinking

> - "Climate is the weather of a place averaged over a period of time, often 30 years." (Source: [NSIDC](https://nsidc.org/cryosphere/arctic-meteorology/climate_vs_weather.html))

> - In the same way, statistics is about overall patterns in data, not the datasets, or individual data points themselves

- Classical statistics is increasingly being challenged by new 'Bayesian' methods [@mcelreath_statistical_2016]:

> - "Whenever someone deploys even a simple statistical procedure, like a classical t-test, she is deploying a small golem that will obediently
carry out an exact calculation."

> - "Without the engineering training, you’re always at someone else’s
mercy."

## Tools for statistical analysis

- Basic tools

> - Data import, cleaning, sharing ('wrangling')
> - Descriptive statistics (mean, median, standard deviation etc.)
> - Visualisation

- Advanced tools 

> - Bayesian data analysis
> - Multilevel models
> - Model comparison using information criteria

## Exploratory data analysis

"Data exploration is the art of looking at your data, rapidly generating hypotheses, quickly testing them, then repeating again and again and again" [@grolemund_r_2016-1]:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("https://r4ds.had.co.nz/diagrams/data-science-explore.png")
```

## Descriptive statistics {.build}

<div style="float: left; width: 40%;">

```{r}
ac_wy = read.csv("ac_wy.csv")
dim(ac_wy)
mean(ac_wy$Speed_limit)
speed_table = table(ac_wy$Speed_limit)
speed_table
```

</div>

<div style="float: right; width: 60%;">

```{r, fig.height=4}
barplot(speed_table)
```

</div>

## Making statistics more meaningful {.build}

```{r, fig.height=3}
speed_proportional = speed_table / nrow(ac_wy)
sum(speed_proportional)
barplot(speed_proportional * 100)
```


## An introduction to R's syntax

Everything that 'exists' is an object

```{r}
x = 1
y = matrix(1:9, nrow = 3)
z = data.frame(y)
```

Everything that happens is a function

```{r}
exp(x)
sqrt(z)
```
