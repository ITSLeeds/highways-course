# A brief history of geographic data in R

R's predecesor was S, which was itself inspired by lisp `r Citep(my_bib, "chambers_extending_2016", .opts = list(cite.style = "authoryear"))`.

This is geographic analysis in S `r Citep(my_bib, "rowlingson_splancs_1993", .opts = list(cite.style = "authoryear"))`:

```
pts <- spoints(scan('cavities'))
uk()
pointmap(pts,add=T) 
zoom()
uk(add=T) 
pointmap(pts,add=T)
poly<-getpoly() 
```

Still works today, 25 years later:

```{r}
library(splancs)
#> Spatial Point Pattern Analysis Code in S-Plus
#> Version 2 - Spatial and Space-Time analysis
```

---

# Live demo (try this)!

```{r, fig.height=4}
# install.packages("splancs"); library(splancs)
# example, interactive! (commented bits)
data(bodmin)
plot(bodmin$poly, asp=1, type="n")
pointmap(as.points(bodmin), add=TRUE)
# zoom()
# pointmap(as.points(bodmin), add=TRUE)
```

---

# Observations
- R' is robust and future-proof 

- See a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Luxllb_WAqY) of Roger Bivand's talk on the subject (live demo of R 0.49) + GitHub [repo](https://github.com/rsbivand/eRum18/blob/master/eRum_keynote_18.Rmd)

- Rs capabilities have evolved substantially since then!

---

# Case study: Geographic data visualization

- An area that illustrates the pace of development
- Rapid growth in number and diversity of packages
- Consolidation, but still many packages to choose from
- `plot()` still best for many tasks

--

- Vital for understanding geographic data. 

--

---

# A brief history of geographic data viz in R

"The core R engine was not designed specifically for the display and analysis
of maps, and the limited interactive facilities it offers have drawbacks in this
area" `r Citep(my_bib, "bivand_applied_2013", .opts = list(cite.style = "authoryear"))`.

--

Five years later...

--

"An example showing R's flexibility and evolving geographic capabilities is **leaflet**
`r Citep(my_bib, "R-leaflet", .opts = list(cite.style = "authoryear"))`,
a package for making interactive maps that has been extended by the R community, as we'll see in Chapter 9" 
`r Citep(my_bib, "lovelace_geocomputation_2018", .opts = list(cite.style = "authoryear"))`.

```{r}
# packages used
library(sf)
library(spData)
library(raster)
```


---

# Base R graphics: sf 

```{r}
plot(nz)
```

--

# tmap

- A diverse dedicated mapping R package

```{r}
library(tmap)
tm_shape(nz) +
  tm_polygons("Median_income", palette = "RdYlBu")
```

---

# Why tmap?

- It is powerful and flexible.
- Concise syntax, attractive maps with minimal code, familiar to **ggplot2** users.
- Unique capability: same code -> static + interactive maps with switch `tmap_mode()`.
- Wide range of spatial classes (including `raster` objects) supported.
- Well documented + developed --- see [`tmap-nutshell`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tmap/vignettes/tmap-nutshell.html) and JSS paper
`r Citep(my_bib, "tennekes_tmap_2018", .opts = list(cite.style = "authoryear"))`.



```{r, fig.cap="tmap basics", out.width="32%", fig.show='hold', echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
# tmap basics
# Add fill layer to nz shape
tm_shape(nz) + tm_fill() 
# Add border layer to nz shape
tm_shape(nz) + tm_borders() 
# Add fill and border layers to nz shape
tm_shape(nz) + tm_fill() + tm_borders() 
```

---

# Animations

- Are easy with **tmap** (section [9.3](http://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/adv-map.html#animated-maps) of geocompr)

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="80%"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1825120/38543030-5794b6f0-3c9b-11e8-9da9-10ec1f3ea726.gif")
```

---

# Interactive maps with mapview

- Lives at https://github.com/r-spatial/mapview

```{r}
m = mapview::mapview(nz)
m@map
```

---

# R's spatial ecosystem

```{r cranlogs, fig.cap="The popularity of spatial packages in R. The y-axis shows the average number of downloads, within a 30-day rolling window, of R's top 5 spatial packages, defined as those with the highest number of downloads last month.", echo=FALSE, out.width="80%"}
knitr::include_graphics("http://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/figures/spatial-package-growth.png")
```

---

# Before spatial packages...

- Coordinates were treated as *just another variable*
- Issues with visualisation, spatial relations and consistency
- Major issues with Coordinate Reference Systems (CRSs)

```{r}
library(spData) # see data(package = "spData") and ?afcon for more info
```

```{r, fig.asp=0.5}
plot(afcon$x, afcon$y)
```

---

# Recap: Where to find out about packages?

Online (dur) but with guidance, e.g. from:

--

- The Spatial Taskview: https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/Spatial.html
- Section 4.4. of [Efficient R Programming](https://csgillespie.github.io/efficientR/workflow.html#package-selection)

A few of note:

- **adehabitat** for ecological modelling
- **geosphere** for operations on a spherical surface
- **spdep** for modelling spatial data
- **rgdal** for reading/writing data

---

# sf

- Released in November 2016
- Aims to supersede **sp**, **rgdal** and **rgeos** with unified interface
- Treats spatial vector data as regular data frames
- The basis of much of this tutorial and *Geocomputation with R*
- Compatible with the *tidyverse* (Wickham and Grolemund 2016)

```{r}
library(sf)
world_tbl = dplyr::as_data_frame(world)
world_tbl
```

---

# raster

- A very large package first released in 2010
- Provides support for raster classes, and user friendly functions for vector data
- Very powerful

```{r, fig.asp=0.5}
library(raster)
r = raster(nrows = 3, ncols = 3)
values(r) = 1:9
plot(r)
```

---

# Visualisation packages

- **ggplot2** support for **sf**
- **leaflet** for low-level control of interactive maps
- **mapview** for GIS-like feel
- **tmap** powerful, flexible, user-friendly, general-purpose map-making

---

# Mini tmap demo

```{r}
library(tmap)
tmap_mode("view")
qtm(us_states, fill = "total_pop_10")
```

---

# The us_states dataset

```{r}
us_states[1:5, 1:3]
```


---
